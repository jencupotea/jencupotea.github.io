							The following are some short prose that I've written. I have an extensive background in student journalism, and while it is no longer the main focus of my portfolio or future careers, including these can still provide insight in my character and written art. I find delight in writing, and have been writing poems ever since I fell in love with it when I was 13.</p>

<br>
<br>And he does, he maps from nation to nation. He’s sure she had already met the same people he’s yet to say hello to, yet to call familiar by the sound and form of their names. He’s sure she had eaten the same fruit under the same tree, the only difference would be the ripeness, the season, or how the flyers plastered beyond the bulletin boards spoke of different missing people. Some must have passed on, some must have been found. He’s confident she drank from the same riverbed by the outskirts of the sleepy village filled with kind people. And he’s also confident that she smiled from their hospitality, just as he had been before frowning to realize that she’s right.
<br>
<br>Why had she turned her back on this world, when his travels had been so pleasant? It was imperfect, just as it should be: tyrannies falling, societies stealing, and dragons sleeping. It was a world he had grown fond of, no shred of regret has rooted itself in his heart.
<br>
<br>His hands had held bows and swords to rebel against kings, grasped cuffs and collars of gold-bearded thieves, and crushed fresh fruits to feed the dragon’s little toothy hatchlings.
<br>
<br>There is no hate in my heart, only a sense of guilt for loving all that is lovable. If you can find it in your senses to go stand on the opposite side of this world, I will follow. But until then, let me be here among the soil, the air, the wholeness of sun—let me be the traveler before I become what’s traveled by.</p>

									<p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">“Is she a furry?” Hana asks, looking at the movie on my phone, propped up on a half-drunk water bottle.
<br>
<br>The leading man’s nails grow longer and sharper. His mat of hair stretches and falls to his shoulder, and the edge of his lips buries itself, seemingly, because his nose protrudes forward to the length of a wolf’s snout. He tips his head down, eyes set on the ground before flitting back to the leading lady’s expression.
<br>
<br>The camera doesn’t cut to her yet. I want to see her.
<br>
<br>“Oh my,” I whisper.
<br>
<br>“Woah, she’s pretty cool.”
<br>
<br>Hana and I stare back at the leading lady, trapped in surprise. The wind picks up on both of them, and her hair gets lost in a calm, quiet expression. Her small hands reach to fit his claws, tracing the roughness, before her body weighs heavy from the happiness in her heart. They lean in each other’s embrace, and though I can never understand what she truly felt at that second, I knew to some extent that she was glad to have been told. 
<br>
<br>So when the woman and her werewolf husband bore two, little werewolf kids, me and Hana agreed it was adorable. They played, and cried, and scratched, and sucked like little human babies. With their tiny heads and tiny pleas, I caught myself fantasizing about what it would be like to assemble the strands of my hair and the pores of my skin, into eyelids curved to be the same way as mine.
<br>
<br>I realized, that I am. I am my mother's child. I have her eyes.
<br>
<br>But then, the werewolf died. The mother and her children moved away from the city. The children grew up without getting to know their father. One of these should be enough reason for waterworks. So how come none of these did it for me?
<br>
<br>I liked watching sad anime movies with Hana, but the difference was that she loved them. Cried to them. And all I ever knew was that they were aptly named in their genre. They were sad.
<br>
<br>But, why was she sad?
<br>
<br>It could be that we had longed for love so much because it wasn’t there to hold our tiny hands growing up. I had sat beside her dry and forlorn because I never learned how to cry. While she, had poured it all out. Hana, that unashamedly messy and bawling kind of Hana, trembling beside me. Perhaps, this is why we got into this habit.
<br>
<br>I wanted my eyes to shed the same tears my mother had through the pain of bearing me into this world, but then all I knew next was that my small hands reach to fit Hana’s palms, relaxing with the heaviness of worry around hers. I asked what was wrong, wiping away tears like everything else was supposed to be right.
<br>
<br>The little were-child in the running movie pleaded his mother through a mat of wet fur around his teary eyes, “How come the wolf always gets to be the bad guy?”
<br>
<br>She asked, “You mean, like in the picture books?”</p>

<br>It was a given to look both ways, left and right. I keep walking. There were no marks, no white strips painted—no pedestrians. Seems like I was the only one around who could remember the old crosswalk, missing in the same way a pencil leaves indentations on the papers of love letters erased.<br>
<br>Because I saw what was there before it was gone. And I know it will die with me when it's my time to be painted over.<br>
<br>Unless I write it down like this, then maybe. Maybe, I'm returning my loss before it could wander alone.</p>
